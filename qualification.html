                        Robotics: I originally joined the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/turtle_robotics/" target = "_blank">Turtle Robotics</a> organization on campus simply to add lines to my resume. However, I was pleasantly surprised by not only how much I learned, but how motivated I was to keep learning. The first project I was assigned was called Beest which involved making a four-legged robot walk with only two motors. My job was to write the movement logic for the motor controllers as well as create functions for other teams to employ in order to connect the robot to a remote controller. This involved heavy research and was a lot of fun. My next project was the germination system shown in the portfolio which presented novel and entertaining challenges. This project required learning how to program an Arduino to receive and output signals to maintain a system. I also had to read documentation for a relay, computer fan, sensors, and a motor. I then implemented a system to make them all work together in harmony towards the end goal of raising a plant. To the plant is our minimum viable product; we hope to iterate on this to create a professional apparatus.

                        Computer Graphics: In the past, I've used 3D modeling software such as <a href = "https://www.blender.org/" target = "_blank">Blender</a> and <a href = "https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" target = "_blank">Maya</a> to make models and simple animations. My favorite project was a rotating Spartan helmet I made for a humanities class. This was not the most complex nor the most engaging project, however, it was my favorite because I made it entirely alone with nothing but a reference picture I found online, and it turned out exactly as intended. When registering for classes I saw a computer graphics course. After asking a friend about it, I learned that they were learning the mechanics behind the modeling I enjoyed so much. Computer graphics is also involved in cinema and video games. I endeavor to understand how such complex, computer-breaking creations are made.
